<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 1-2</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Variables</b>: abstractions within programs which represent a value</li>
    <li><b>Lists</b>: made up of elements organized in a specific order</li>
    <li><b>Element</b>: unique, individual value in a list</li>
</ul>


<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 3-4</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Index</b>: number representing a position, like a character's position in a string or a string's position in a list.</li>
    <li><b>Concatenation</b>: series of interconnected things</li>
    <li><b>Substring</b>: subset of a bigger string</li>
    <li><b>Pseudocode</b>: writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 5 and 7</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Boolean Operators</b>: produces booleans after it is used between two values</li>
    <li><b>Relational Operators</b>: can work between any two values of the same type known as operands, provided that the type supports such types of operators</li>
    <li><b>Logical Operators</b>: operators that works on operand(s) to produce a single boolean result. Examples include and, or, not.</li>
    <li><b>ALgorithm</b>: A set of instructions that accomplish a task</li>
    <li><b>Selection</b>: The process that determines which parts of an algoritm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false</li>
    <li><b>Nested Conditionals</b>: consist of conditional statements within conditional statements</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Lists</b>: collections of data</ul>li>
    <li><b>Indexes</b>: Most code languages count starting with zero, and this is also the case for list indexes</li>
    <li><b>Repetition</b>: repetition of a function. Allowing a function to repeat on its own based on various conditions can vastly optimize a program</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 12 and 13</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Parameters</b>: input values of a procedure</ul></li>
    <li><b>Procedure</b>: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.</li>
    <li><b>Arguments</b>: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called</li>
    <li><b>Modularity</b>: Separating a program's functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality</li>
    <li><b>Procedural Abstraction</b>: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 9 and 11</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Binary Search</b>: efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value</ul></li>
    <li><b>Searching Algorithms</b>: could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each</li>
    <li><b>Algorithms</b>: can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 14 and 15</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Packages</b>: allow a python user to import methods from a library</ul></li>
    <li><b>Random Values</b>: number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Section 16</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Simulations</b>: abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Unit 3 Sections 17 and 18</b></h1>
<ul>
    <li><b>Problem</b>: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically</ul></li>
    <li><b>Decision Problem</b>: A problem with a yes or no answer</ul></li>
    <li><b>Organization Problem</b>: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer</ul></li>
    <li><b>Instance</b>: a problem with a specific input2 </ul></li>
    <li><b>Efficiency</b>: amount of computing needed to solve a problem </ul></li>
    <li><b>Polynomial Efficiency (Good)</b>: more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time) </ul></li>
    <li><b>Exponential Efficiency (Bad)</b>: more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time) </ul></li>
    <li><b>Heuristic Approach</b>: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient </ul></li>
    <li><b>Decidable Problem</b>: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output </ul></li>
    <li><b>Undecidable Problem</b>: A decision problem with no solution that is not gaurenteed to produce the correct output </ul></li>
</ul>
