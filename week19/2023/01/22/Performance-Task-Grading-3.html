<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 4, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not. This is because the response did not call the actual procedure, which I overlooked. The student also doesn’t specify how the procedure contributes to the overall program, which is another requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded the same as Collegeboard, a full score. I could definitely tell this was a really good example because they got 6/6, so I will link it here.

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded almost the same as Collegeboard, just for Row 3 I awarded a point and Collegeboard didn’t. I can now see that the student was too general and did not give specific insight to how the code cannot be written without the list.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded a little differently than Collegeboard here. For row 6, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard didn’t. I can see why now: the response doesn’t give specific arguments, only general ones. The student describes the code segments, not the actual results.</p>
