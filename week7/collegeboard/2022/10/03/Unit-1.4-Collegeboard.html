<ul>
  <li>It is an expectation that errors are part of the coding progress</li>
  <li>Types of errors:
    <ul>
      <li>Logic error: mistake in the algorithm</li>
      <li>Syntax error: mistake in the coding language (ex: forgot semicolon in C++ or JavaScript)</li>
      <li>Run-time error: program fails when running, aka “bug” (ex: dividing by zero)</li>
      <li>Overflow error: calculation required outside of memory allocations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How to correct errors…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easiest error to correct is usually syntax error (IDE helps with this)</li>
  <li>Logic errors can be solved by using test cases, hand tracing (when dealing with loops)</li>
  <li>Extra output statements</li>
  <li>Debuggers</li>
  <li>Visualizations show graphs, images, color</li>
</ul>

  <li>Programmers test test test test for inputs and outputs, use results to revise, refine, and improve the programs</li>

<ul>
  <li>What errors may arise in your project?
    <ul>
      <li>Many syntax errors may arise in my project because I might not be fully familiar with the coding language of Python. Also, logic errors may arise because I have never designed a journal before or a similar application. Finally, errors with the display may occur because graphic formatting is not an area I am experienced in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are some test cases that can be used?
    <ul>
      <li>Some test cases that can be used are to just create some journals and test if the ratings work and show up or not.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem.
    <ul>
      <li>If any bugs or issues come up, I can talk to my group, research online (ex: on forums like Stack Overflow), and also create a GitHub issue if the problem persists. I can also ask other classmates as well as Mr. Yeung for assistance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project?
    <ul>
      <li>I will periodically run the code and see if it is displaying the right things I want it to based on what I have coded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests.
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Code the interface and test to make sure it shows up</li>
      <li>Step 2: Code the journal interface and test to make sure it shows up</li>
      <li>Step 3: Code the lists and saving and test to make sure it saves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I completed the collegeboard quiz.</p>

<p>My group’s final project idea is to create a scheduling/planning website where you can plan out your events and schedule. We also want to add other features like mood tracking! It can be like a well-being app, related to journaling and psychology. It’s like related to the Psychology and Good Life video we watched.</p>

<p>It is for an educational purpose because it’ll help us develop our coding things. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as rating your productivity in the day, rating how happy you were, etc.</p>

<p>This project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because planning/scheduling is very important to people’s lives.</p>

<p>This project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Program Purpose and Function
    <ul>
      <li>The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can schedule and plan out their day, as well as take into account their mindfulness and mental health.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>Information such as ratings and scales will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managing Complexity
    <ul>
      <li>The list will have to contain the items to display.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Procedural Abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>The procedures will involve creating events or tasks, or creating journal entries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Algorithm Implementation
    <ul>
      <li>Looping through days and months and years will require algorithm implementation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing
    <ul>
      <li>There can be functions such as “overview of your week” that need to call different values from different places.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
