<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 4, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not. This is because the response did not describe how the procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program, as it only said it was used to determine if the user’s guess was right or wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded almost the same as Collegeboard, I just gave 0 points for Row 5 while Collegeboard gave a point. I can now see that the student’s explanation was adequate. This was a really good example because they got 6/6, so I will link it here.

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded exactly the same as Collegeboard here, basically the only thing missing was the purpose of the program. This is different than the functionality of the program! because the purpose should address the problem being solved or the creative interest being pursued by the program. The function is different because it is how the program works during execution and how the user interacts with it. The purpose is basically the underlying meaning, while the function is how it works.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded a little differently than Collegeboard here. For row 2, I shouldn’t have awarded a point because the second code segment didn’t access the actual list, it only took the length. For row 3, the list doesn’t manage complexity. FOr row 6, it doesn’t give specific arguments.</p>
