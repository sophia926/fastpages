### Submission 1


| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | The video is comprehensive with the input and ouput as well as program functionality, and the written response not only gives theh functionality/input/output, but also describes the overarching purpose of the program (entertainment) | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | The second code segment doesn't include the list in the previous iamge. | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | The explanation doesn't talk about how the list is used because the list isn't even used in the second code segment. | 0 |
| 4 | 1 | The code segments show the procedure and it being used | 0 |
| 5 | 1 | The student very detailed describes the code segment and what it does. | 01 |
| 6 | 1 | There are two separate calls with two separate results. | 1 |


**Reflection**: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 4, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not. This is because the response did not call the actual procedure, which I overlooked. The student also doesn't specify how the procedure contributes to the overall program, which is another requirement.

### Submission 2

| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates the program and the purpose is also clearly described, to help one with one's English vocabulary! | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | Two code segments are shown, the list and also how it's used. | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | The student clearly explains how the list is being used to manage complexity and how the program would be much more complicated without it. | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | The student shows the procedure and the procedure being called. | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | The student explains how the procedure is necessary and also how it works in detail. | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | The student shows two different tests and results. | 1 |

**Reflection**: I graded the same as Collegeboard, a full score. I could definitely tell this was a really good example because they got 6/6, so I will link it here. Here is the [link to the written responses](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2022-create-performance-task-sample-c.pdf) and the [link to the video](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/ap-computer-science-principles-2022-create-performance-task-sample-c-video.mp4).

### Submission 3


| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | The video shows the functionality, and the student describes the purpose.  | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | The first image doesn't show a list at all. | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | The student explains how the list is used to manage complexity and explains how it works. | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | The procedure doesn't have an input parameter, which is required. | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | The student doesn't fully explain the algorithm because it is pretty vague. | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | The student doesn't provide two outside test cases. | 0 |



**Reflection**: I graded almost the same as Collegeboard, just for Row 3 I awarded a point and Collegeboard didn't. I can now see that the student was too general and did not give specific insight to how the code cannot be written without the list.


### Submission 4


| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | The video shows the program running and the written response describes the function and purpose. | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | The student shows two code segments and talks about the list. | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | The student describes that the list is ncessary for the program, like the program would be very easily changed if another fish would be to added. | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | The student shows their procedure and the procedure being called in the program. | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | The student details how the procedure works to demonstrate they know the function and how it contributes to the program overall. | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | Two test cases are shown and their results. | 0 |



**Reflection**: I graded a little differently than Collegeboard here. For row 6, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard didn't. I can see why now: the response doesn't give specific arguments, only general ones. The student describes the code segments, not the actual results.
