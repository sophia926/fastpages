### Submission 1
| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | The purpose only describes the functionality of the program, not the problem being solved. | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | All the code is shown, meeting the requirements of showing the list of the data and the list being used. | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | The person explains why the list is necessary. | 0 |
| 4 | 1 | There are two code segments and the person also describes the procedure. | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | The explanation is extremely detailed, as it basically goes through every line and explains what it does. | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | The person tests two different calls, gives the result of each, and explains the conditions for each call and how the result was obtained. | 1 |

**Reflection**: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 3, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not. This is because the list does not manage complexity and is not absolutely necessary for the program. I can now see that the list is not necessary because return statements of strings would achieve the same result.

### Submission 2
| Row | My Score | My Reasoning | Collegeboard Actual Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | 1 | The person describes the purpose as well as the functionality, which are two different things. The person also explains the inputs and outputs. | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | The code is shown and the lists are named. | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | The list is absolutely necessary because of the large size, there are many elements being stored, so a list is very useful. The person describes this very well. | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | The person gives the procedure code and also describes what the procedure does. | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | The person gives the algorithm and explains how it works. | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | The person gives two different scenarios and also tells us the conditions being tested. Then, the person shows the results of the two calls, and the results are also different. | 1 |

**Reflection**: I graded exactly the same as Collegeboard here, all 1s. I could definitely tell this person was very detailed and thoroughly completed the Performance Task, and Collegeboard saw the same. This is a good example of the Performance Task, and I will definitely be saving it for future reference for when I create my Performance Task. I can use this as a base and a model for mine, to make sure I can achieve the maximum score as well. I will save the link to this person's Performance Task for reference.
