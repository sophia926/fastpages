### Individual Blog
- This trimester I want to focus on reviewing for the AP Exam. I aim to get a 5 on the AP exam, which menas I need to study. The following are some things that I will work on this trimester in order to achieve this:
    1. Take practice questions on the Collegeboard classroom.
    2. Review past topics by reviewing blogs and notebooks on the APCSP website.
    3. Search up flashcards and key terms such as on quizlet.
    4. Focus on my final project to master the topic I have.
    5. Engage with classmates' final projects to master all other topics.

### CPT Plan
I hope to have a completed CPT before 5/1 which is the due date. To achieve this, I will make some improvements every single week, such as fixing/editing the writeup and also adding code to enhance my project.
