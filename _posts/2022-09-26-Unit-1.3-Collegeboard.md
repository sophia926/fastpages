## Collegeboard 1.3

### Notes on 1.3 Daily Video 1
- A program is developed from an idea and a specific purpose in mind.
- Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.
- Developers must:
    - determine requirements of program
    - understand the constraints (ex: time)
    - understand user concerns/interests
- Developers investigate using surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations
- Developers design program by brainstorming, storyboard, plan user experience, layout user interface, organize into modules, develop a testing strategy
- Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave, include a liste of user interactions
- Developers create a prototype of program
- Testing, testing, testing!! Very important at micro level and macro level

### Notes on 1.3 Daily Video 2
- Programs are usually developed by teams of people. Individuals work on different functional components. Everyone msut receive credit for what they've done.
- Use comments to give credit. Comments are very useful.
- You can also use code segments written by others, but this needs to be credited.

### Notes on 1.3 Daily Video 3
- Program documentation describes the overall program, lists the program specifications, describes functions/procedures/methods
- Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: at the beginning, during, and after

### Program Design and Development Quiz
I took the quiz and got 3/3!
I have now completed all quizzes 1.1-1.3

For the Program Function and Purpose Quiz (MCQs), I made a couple simple mistakes on the questions, but I understand how to do them now.

    - Rating of productivity (1-10)
    - Text box to journal about day
    - Gratitude section (3 gratitudes) --> including Psychology and the GOod Life
- Constraints
    - Limited coding knowledge (our group members don't have extensive Python knowledge)
    - Time restraints (due in November)
- Impact of project
    - Improve people's mental health and well-being
    - No negative aspects
- We have established group roles on our group website.
- **Frontend**: The frontend will have a nice aesthetic layout. Here are some images drawing that I created that our journal will look like.
- **Backend**: The backend will be made using jupyter notebooks and python! We plan to share a GitHub repository with some python files to create our project.
