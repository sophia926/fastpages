### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects

**Grammarly**
- __Benefits__: Real time grammar checking, improved writing, easy to understand explanations, expanded vocabulary use and diction
- __Disadvantages__: premium costs money so students without Grammarly Premium (unable to pay for the premium subscription) are at an academic disadvantage to those students who do have Premium

**Artificial Intelligence**
- __Benefits__: Reduces human error with automated tasks, available 24/7, helpful in repetitive jobs such as in product manufacturing
- __Disadvantages__: may make unemployment worse and replace human jobs, makes humans lazy, lacks creativity and out of the box thinking, very limited to the data you train it with

**Self Driving Cars**
- __Benefits__: decreased traffic flow from self driving cars able to navigate more efficiently, easier access for disabled and elderly since they can just have the cars drive for them
- __Disadvantages__: needs large scale adoption in order to be effective, hackers and cybersecurity threats to the cars, moral dilemna of what happens in the case of a car crash

**Dopamine Issue**
- I think addiction / dopamine issue is real, and that technology is meant ot be addictive. I watched "The Social Dilemna" on Netflix and it shockingly explains that social media is literally built so that you get addicted. Every feature and aspect is fine tuned to target your brain's reward systems and release dopamine. This is dangerous because it can lead to physical and mental health issues. It can harm students because they get addicted to technology/games/social media instead of studying and as a result their grades can decline.

### 5.2 Digital Divide
- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
    - Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by staying in control of all their online and digital activities/interactions with technology, rather than letting others or the Internet control them. One can stay aware of their activities and what they are doing, to gauge whether it is healthy or not. One should also take action to protect themselves online, such as making secure passwords and personalizing privacy settings.
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
    - Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by asking them what they need help with but also not embarrasing or humiliating them by doing that. Something you can do at DNHS is to join clubs that empower those who need it.
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
    - Paper isn't blocking digital empowerment because there are still things that are necessary to be on paper. DNHS does have some barriers to digital empowerment because we still do some activities on paper, such as math tests. Elsewhere, there are still barriers to digital empowerment, such as lack of funding or infrastructure, especially in third world countries.
