- Boolean operators produces booleans after it is used between two values
- Logical oeprators works on operand(s) to produce a single boolean result. Examples include and, or, not.
- Relational and Logical Operators can work by a set of precedece, a set of order that the computer understands the operations on.
- In almost every programming language, if/else statements fill in the role of the conditional
- A conditional is a statement that affects the flow/outcome of a program by executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement. That true or false statement is a boolean expression.
- Nested Conditional Statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements
- Relational Operators can work between any two values of the same type known as operands, provided that the type supports such types of operators They consist of the operators ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, each one working the same way that they work as one would expect, with == being the replacement for equal to, since = is reserved for value assignments.
