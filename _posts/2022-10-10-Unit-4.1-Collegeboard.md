## Collegeboard 4.1

### Notes on 4.1 Daily Video 1
- Started with huge computers, evolved to smaller computers
- A **packet** is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet includes the source and destination information.
- A **computer system** is a group of computing devices/programs working together
- A **computer network** is a group of interconnected devices that send/receive data
- **Packing switching**: the message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order, the packets are reassembled at the destination
- **Bandwidth**: max amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network (bits/second)
- **Route**: process of finding a path from sender to receiver
- **Path**: sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver

### Notes on 4.1 Daily Video 2
- **Protocol**: agreed upon set of rules that specify the behavior of the system
- **OSI**: layers you have to go through to communicate, 7 groups of protocols
- **IETF**: manages the development of standards and technical discussions concerning the Internet in an open/collaborative process
- **TCP**: estasblishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the Internet

- **Network Access Layer**: deals with the hardware
- **Internet Layer Data Transmission**: packet contains data that's transmitted as well as metadta containing information used for routing, Internet was designed to be scalable
- Internet is Scalable: LAN, Intranet, Automonous System (tens of thousands of Intranets), Internet
- **Transport Layer**: TCP (error checking/error recover, slower) and UDP (error checking but discards erroneous packets), port number assigned to an application or service
- **Internet Layer**: unicast, multicast, broadcast
- **Application Layer**: Web servers and DNS (maps names to IPs)

### Collegeboard Quiz
I got this question wrong, but I now understand the correct answer. The Inernet is dynamic and always changing, so basically open data protocols are just a way to **standardize data transmission** between networking and end devices.
