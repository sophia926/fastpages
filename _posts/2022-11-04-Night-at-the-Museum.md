description: This is my experience attending the DNHS Night at the Museum

### Classes I visited
I visited many classrooms. I started in the APCSP classroom to show my project and get it graded. Then, I visited the Digital Media class's exhibition, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, and also Ceramics. It was an interesting experience because I got to see all types of art. I also saw the 3D Animation projects, which were really creative. Overall, I was exposed to more of DNHS's creative potential, and I realized that DNHS is really diverse and has a lot of people with many interesting, creative thoughts and ideas. I was able to see people's different artistic styles, it was almost as if they knew exactly what they wanted to communicate and how to communicate it best. Here are some images of the night!

### Next Trimester
Some ideas I have for next trimester is to do an interactive game with the user, so it is more exciting and more on the entertainmnet side. Because life is all about balance, we could do like a game, something you can play when you're stressed out or when you're bored. I thought one group's jeopardy idea was super interesting, it's a game and very educational.

Another thing that I thought was cool was one group's project, which was voting on Taylor Swift's albums. That's really cool, it's like getting the opinion of a lot of people for a vote.
