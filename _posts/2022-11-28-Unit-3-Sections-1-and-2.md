- Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value
- Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values
- Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings
- A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order
- An element is a unique, individual value in a list
- A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements
- Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table

- python lists are very powerful and you can organize different elements into lists
- variables are very powerful because you can perform math, functions, dictionaries, and lots of other things on variables that make themv ery flexible
