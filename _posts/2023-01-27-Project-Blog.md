Because this is the project we are submitting for the CB CPT, each person's section of the project must meet all requirements for the CPT. It should include all the requirements, like we have been grading in our previous blogs.

For my group's CPT, we are going to create a website that helps students manage their school and productivity life, to help high achieving studets. The intended audience is high school students specifically. Personally, I'm going to be working on the "MyDay" portion, which is where users will enter in their tasks and ETA, and then the system will output and estimated bed time.

In my writeup and video, I will explicitly say the program purpose and functionality, which I have already planned out and described. I will be able to test the program, inputting different tasks and estimated times. I will also be able to go in-depth to describe the algorithms that I'll use, how complexity is used to manage lists (since mine is a todo list, lists will be essential), and how my backend uses many complex program algorithms.

In the video, I will show inputting different tasks and show how the Estimated Time changes.
