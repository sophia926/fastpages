## Collegeboard 1.4

### Notes on 1.4 Daily Video 1
- It is an expectation that errors are part of the coding progress
- Types of errors:
    - Logic error: mistake in the algorithm
    - Syntax error: mistake in the coding language (ex: forgot semicolon in C++ or JavaScript)
    - Run-time error: program fails when running, aka "bug" (ex: dividing by zero)
    - Overflow error: calculation required outside of memory allocations

### Notes on 1.4 Daily Video 2
How to correct errors...
- Easiest error to correct is usually syntax error (IDE helps with this)
- Logic errors can be solved by using test cases, hand tracing (when dealing with loops)
- Extra output statements
- Debuggers
- Visualizations show graphs, images, color

### Notes on 1.4 Daily Video 3
- Programmers test test test test for inputs and outputs, use results to revise, refine, and improve the programs

### Hacks
- What errors may arise in your project?
    - Many syntax errors may arise in my project because I might not be fully familiar with the coding language of Python. Also, logic errors may arise because I have never designed a journal before or a similar application. Finally, errors with the display may occur because graphic formatting is not an area I am experienced in.
- What are some test cases that can be used?
    - Some test cases that can be used are to just create some journals and test if the ratings work and show up or not.
- Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem.
    - If any bugs or issues come up, I can talk to my group, research online (ex: on forums like Stack Overflow), and also create a GitHub issue if the problem persists. I can also ask other classmates as well as Mr. Yeung for assistance.
- What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project?
    - I will periodically run the code and see if it is displaying the right things I want it to based on what I have coded.
- As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests.
    - Step 1: Code the interface and test to make sure it shows up
    - Step 2: Code the journal interface and test to make sure it shows up
    - Step 3: Code the lists and saving and test to make sure it saves
