    "![](../images/week31duckdns.png)\n",
    "HACK 2: Write a reflection. Why do we use DNS? How does DuckDNS work? What makes DuckDNS unique? How is DuckDNS useful for our projects? What are the steps to setup DuckDNS?\n",
    "- DNS is Domain name system, and its purpose is to translate a domain name into the appropriate IP address and this makes it user friendly because instead of typing in an IP address to access a website, users can instead type a word which is much easier to remember, such as \"google.com\" which everyone knows. DuckDNS helps users  assign a domain name to a dynamic IP. It's unique in the way that it is free, unlike many other services, however it does have limited functionality because of this. you can use it for projects to prive a hostname that can be accessed ona ny device.\n",
