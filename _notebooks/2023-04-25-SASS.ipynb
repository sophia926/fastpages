    "### In your own words, explain what SASS does:\n",
    "- SASS is related to CSS, and it lets you have variables, math operations (ex: addition, division), loops, imports, functions, and other functions/tools to make your CSS more powerful and useful with more functions. Essentially, it's an extension used to style your webpages/frontends that reduce CSS complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "- Some beenfits are that it helps you write clean/easy/less CSS, contains fewere codes (less complex), and it is more powerful, allows for greater efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- Advanced sass is more compatible with more devices to it helps the user satisfaction. Fade-in means keyframes, which access different aspects of information at differing times. You can state specific properties like duration, delay, direction, etc. to customize your animation.\n",

    "1. Random number is generated\n",
    "2. Using \"documentGetElementByID\", the user input is accessed.\n",
    "3. User input is compared to previously generated number.\n",
    "4. Guess is compared to the actual number\n",
    "5. Different outpus show depending on if the guess is right, too large, or too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- SASS elements can be used to change colors, so that the user can visually see if their answer is right or wrong. You can add images and style containers as well, such as make rounded edges to make it more aesthetically appealing. Also, you can change the font style and size to make the UI more interesting, which helps the user stay engaged.\n"
