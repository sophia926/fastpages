<ul>
  <li>Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used.</li>
  <li>Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we’re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms.</li>
  <li>You must think about your process to develop your algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="searching">
<a class="anchor" href="#searching" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Searching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it’s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each.</li>
  <li>Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work.</li>
</ul>
