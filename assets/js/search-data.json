            "content": "N@TM Reflection Blog . I visited many classrooms. I started in the APCSP classroom to show my project and get it graded. I saw many interesting projects. One of them that I really liked was a recipe project that used APIs to get recipes and nutritional information. I love cooking and am a big foodie, so this project really appealed to me and inspired me. Seeing everyone’s final projects was very motivating because it truly shows the power of CS and how a small team can get so much done in just a few weeks by collaborating and CODING! . I also visited the Photography and Art exhibitions. It was an interesting experience because I got to see all types of art. Overall, I was exposed to more of DNHS’s creative potential, and I realized that DNHS is really diverse and has a lot of people with many interesting, creative thoughts and ideas. I was able to see people’s different artistic styles, it was almost as if they knew exactly what they wanted to communicate and how to communicate it best. Here are some images of the night! .

            "content": "Because this is the project we are submitting for the CB CPT, each person’s section of the project must meet all requirements for the CPT. It should include all the requirements, like we have been grading in our previous blogs. . For my group’s CPT, we are going to create a website that helps students manage their school and productivity life, to help high achieving studets. The intended audience is high school students specifically. Personally, I’m going to be working on the “MyDay” portion, which is where users will enter in their tasks and ETA, and then the system will output and estimated bed time. . In my writeup and video, I will explicitly say the program purpose and functionality, which I have already planned out and described. I will be able to test the program, inputting different tasks and estimated times. I will also be able to go in-depth to describe the algorithms that I’ll use, how complexity is used to manage lists (since mine is a todo list, lists will be essential), and how my backend uses many complex program algorithms. .

            "content": "5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects . Grammarly . Benefits: Real time grammar checking, improved writing, easy to understand explanations, expanded vocabulary use and diction | Disadvantages: premium costs money so students without Grammarly Premium (unable to pay for the premium subscription) are at an academic disadvantage to those students who do have Premium | . Artificial Intelligence . Benefits: Reduces human error with automated tasks, available 24/7, helpful in repetitive jobs such as in product manufacturing | Disadvantages: may make unemployment worse and replace human jobs, makes humans lazy, lacks creativity and out of the box thinking, very limited to the data you train it with | . Self Driving Cars . Benefits: decreased traffic flow from self driving cars able to navigate more efficiently, easier access for disabled and elderly since they can just have the cars drive for them | Disadvantages: needs large scale adoption in order to be effective, hackers and cybersecurity threats to the cars, moral dilemna of what happens in the case of a car crash | . Dopamine Issue . I think addiction / dopamine issue is real, and that technology is meant ot be addictive. I watched “The Social Dilemna” on Netflix and it shockingly explains that social media is literally built so that you get addicted. Every feature and aspect is fine tuned to target your brain’s reward systems and release dopamine. This is dangerous because it can lead to physical and mental health issues. It can harm students because they get addicted to technology/games/social media instead of studying and as a result their grades can decline. | . 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by staying in control of all their online and digital activities/interactions with technology, rather than letting others or the Internet control them. One can stay aware of their activities and what they are doing, to gauge whether it is healthy or not. One should also take action to protect themselves online, such as making secure passwords and personalizing privacy settings. | . | How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by asking them what they need help with but also not embarrasing or humiliating them by doing that. Something you can do at DNHS is to join clubs that empower those who need it. | . | Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Paper isn’t blocking digital empowerment because there are still things that are necessary to be on paper. DNHS does have some barriers to digital empowerment because we still do some activities on paper, such as math tests. Elsewhere, there are still barriers to digital empowerment, such as lack of funding or infrastructure, especially in third world countries. | . | . 5.3 Computing Bias . Facebook VS Instagram: Facebook targets the older generation, while Instagram/Tiktok/Snapchat target the teenager population and overlal younger demographics. So Facebook is more content-driven and information-based, while the other younger social media platforms try to hop on trends to attract the younger generation’s attention. | Virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri by default have female voices. This can potentially be harmful because it can reinforce the stereotype that women are subordinate and can only help in management, while men are the people that actually control and manage tasks. However, this can also be just a result of companies wanting to maximize profits after results from testing show that people prefer female voices over male voices. | Many algorithms influence your decisions because they try to get you addicted to their platform. For instance, YouTube tracks the types of videos you have watched in the past and recommends similar videos. Also, Netflix and YouTube employ autoplay to try to get you to stay on their platform longer. These algorithms also hop on trends and recommend you things that society/the general population currently likes. | The HP camera didn’t have enough training data, or in other words it didn’t have complete trianing data that encompassed all demographics, because it didn’t recognize the Black person’s face. THis is harmful and should be corrected by including data that is inclusive of everybody. This practice is very harmful because it makes it seem like Black people aren’t real people, according to the camera/algorithm. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A crowdsource idea would be to gather some data from APCSP students, such as for a survey about their extracurriculars or school or their opinion on a certain topic. | . | What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Our project includes crowdsourcing from DNHS because it is actually specifically targeted towards DNHS students, as we collect the students’ schedules, teachers, and other school-related information | . | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week Some data that we could capture at N@TM would be to ask some students to create accounts and enter in their data on our project, and then use this to test it out, because that is the whole purpose of the project. This would showcase the function and purpose of our project very well. | . | . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. MIT license is pretty good. Some permissions are commercial use, distribution, modification, and private use. The limitations are liability and warranty. | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. Software licenses have legal implications because they aren’t always followed. Digital rights are also a concern because information is still often pirated online. | . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update I have the Apache License 2.0 for my personal fastpages. I chose this because the limitations are liability, trademark use, and warranty, meaning that the main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/ | For my group project frontend and backend, I applied the GNU GPLv3 license (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). We created the LICENSE.md file to edit the license. We created a text file called LICENSE.md in the root of our source code (main branch) and copied the text of the license into the file. This license has the following permissions: commerical use, distribution, modification, patent use, and private use. The conditions are: disclose source, license and copyright notice, same license, and state changes. The limitations are: liability and warranty. We chose this license because others have to disclose our source if they use our code. | . | . 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. I have seen student names, student grades, and also student classes in CompSci Principles projects. | . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I am insecure about PII and my personal exposure because I genuinely don’t want other people to know things like my address, phone #, and the people I live with because that information should stay with me and it’s insecure to have it on the web. | . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Good passwords are passwords that are long, are complex, and have complex characters. They also shouldn’t contain PII, like birthdays. They shouldn’t be simple like “qwerty” or have common dictionary words because those are easily crackable by password cracking tools, such as John the Ripper. | Another step used to assist authentication is encryption, such as synchronous and async encryption. Keys are also important. This can protect your information as you send it online. | . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is less secure because one key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in asymmetric encryption different keys are used. | . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. An example of encryption was the RSA and SHA keys. | . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. I learned about phishing when I received some spam emails claiming I won some awards. Some phishing techniques are to say that you can get a free thing by entering in some PII, like credit cards or addresses. | . | .",

            "content": "My Score . I got a 90% exactly: 45/50 . Questions I Got Wrong . Question 13 I can see now that choice III is also right because it basically does the same thing as II but flipped. Like it tests if the person is less than 18 and then if they are older than 16, and II is vice versa. . Question 16 I now understand that sequencing is applying steps in a specific order, which was already a function of the algorithm. Selection would be necessary because you need to select only the even numbers to sum, and therefore C is correct. . Question 27 I now see that the option I chose would not be the correct algorithm because the cursor needs to move forward n times and then turn, not alternate moving forward and turning. . Question 45 A heuristic solution is when you are on a time crunch, so you just need an approximate solution in a reasonable amount of time. I can now see that option C is correct. I had misunderstood Option A before. . Overall Reflection . I completed the quiz pretty easily, and I thought most of the questions were pretty straightforward. I might have to review some vocabulary though, because questions 16 and 45 were both vocabulary-based, and I got them wrong. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Reflection: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 4, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not.

Reflection: I graded exactly the same as Collegeboard here, basically the only thing missing was the purpose of the program. This is different than the functionality of the program! because the purpose should address the problem being solved or the creative interest being pursued by the program. The function is different because it is how the program works during execution and how the user interacts with it.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word from, followed by the package name, then the word import, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use *. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word as, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random from random import randint import random as rand . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . The command I used that wasn&#39;t mentioned was &quot;oogway.backward&quot; . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | computes the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial of x (for example factorial(4) is 4) | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package!

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . I chose option 1. I also added something extra where the length of the sides of the polygon is randomized, also the user can input a color! .",

Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: other names for procedures include methods, strategies, . Why are procedures effective?: have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program, Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code, MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure, able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does, helps identify errors/bugs . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . function convertToBinary(n) { const result = n.toString(parseInt(2)); return result; } convertToBinary(10); . &#39;1010&#39; . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . function findMax(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &gt; numberB) { return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } function findMin(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &lt; numberB) { return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } console.log(findMax(10, 20)); console.log(findMin(10, 20)); . 20 10 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . function convert(hello){ var output = &quot;&quot;; output.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;; for (var i = 0; i &lt; hello.length; i++){ output = output + hello[i].charCodeAt(0).toString(2) + &quot; &quot;; } return output; } console.log(&quot;APCSP to binary is...&quot;) console.log(convert(&quot;APCSP&quot;)); . APCSP to binary is... 1000001 1010000 1000011 1010011 1010000 . I did everything in JavaScript, and I also did the challenge for the HW (converting &quot;APCSP&quot; to binary). .",

Items in lists are located with indexes, which, in most code languages, start with 0 (though the pseudocode used by CollegeBoard usually starts at 1!). | Lists are incredibly helpful because you can use them to store unlimited amounts of data, and using loops and functions that locate list data using indexes, the information can be procedurally used in a way that suits a certain purpose. | .

            "content": "Psychology and the Good Life Notes . Here are my notes from the video: . This enterprise if possible: We can improve our well-being, and we can control much more than we think. | . | Circumstances don’t matter that much. We think life’s circumstances matter a lot, but they don’t matter as much as we think. For example, winning the loterry. What we think will make us happy often doesn’t after some time, and the vice versa is true. Perhaps life circumstances only affect 10%. | . | Taking control of it, is kind of hard. You can bump up your own well-being if you do it everyday. You need to have permanent changes and be consistent with it. It’s going to take some work. You have to put the stuff in practice, not just learning it. | . | One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuitions don’t work. Your mind is lying to you a lot of the time when you think you’re happy. For example, illusions tric your mind so you can’t fully rely on your mind! We forecast stuff that will make us happy, when in reality it doesn’t in the end. For example, we predict that we need more money to be happy (choosing a job based on salary), but when are you going to be satisfied? Ever? | . | Make time for social connection Prioritize the people you care about in life. Spend more time with others, family, friends, loved ones. Spend less time alone. | . | Helping others Helping others help us more than we expect! Happy people give their time to others and spend money on others. | . | Make time for gratitude Many people talk about their hassles in life (ugh, that person is so annoying) rather than the other 99% of people that make your life great! You can make a gratitude list or even express your gratitude with a letter, for example. | . | Healthy practices matter Exercise (1/2 hour of cardio a day is the equivalent of anti-depressants), sleep (current HS students average 4-5 hours a night). These all improve mood GREATLY! | . | Taking time in the present moment Don’t be distracted by your electronics, phones, etc. Realize you are in the present! | . | Become wealthy (in terms of time) Don’t have a time famine (“I don’t have time for anything!”) People who priotize time over money have a better well-being. | . | Gratitude List . I am grateful for many things. Here are some: . friends and family | plentiful, healthy, and delicious food | going to school and being able to learn | the ability to move around and exercise | going to social events and hanging out with people | music that I can listen to in any mood | . Gratitude to my friend . Here is a gratitude message I sent to my friend: “i just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me and thanks for being my best friend and staying with me no matter what :)” . Gratitude to someone at home . Here is a gratitude I wrote to my mom: “Thank you for being the very best mom to me! You are such an amazing person and I love you so much! Thanks for putting up with me for already 15 years, I can’t even believe it :)” . Goals . Here are some goals I want to set. . Studying and Academic - I want to be productive and study well. I don’t want to get distracted and procrastinate when I’m working. I will take some short breaks, but I will get all my work done before doing other things. | Personal Life - I want to focus on myself as well. I want to do something that I enjoy doing at least once every day. That can be something as simple as reading or cooking, but I want to be able to enjoy everyday. | Reading - I want to read more because I’m a little busy nowadays, so I barely read anymore. This ties along with my first goal because if I’m more productive, I can have more time for my personal life and reading as well. | My Personal Journey for Computer Science . I want to learn a lot in this APCSP class. I also want to join a coding club at school. Also, I want to learn some more coding, like Python and C++. . Something I Did For Myself . On Thursday (9/15), I cooked something I wanted to for a long time. I was very stressed from my workload and all the work I had to do, but I wnated to take a step back and just de-stress. This would help my mood and minset to be more productive after dinner! So I made avocado pasta and it actually turned out pretty good :) My mom also liked it! .",

The todo list data and goal data will be stored in databases and lists. . Managing Complexity . The database and list will manage the complexity of the program because it is necessary for filtering and displaying. . Procedural Abstraction . I will create functions for filtering the data for the user to see, which is a procedural abstraction. . Algorithm Implementation . I will create functions for sequencing, selecting, and iterating for displaying the goals and todo lists, which satisfies this condition. . Testing . When the user interacts with the program, it will constantly call the functions I will code, which satisfies this requirement. . AP Exam MCQ .

Question 1: Which of the following foods can never go bad? Answers: chocolate, hard candy, honey (correct), water . Question 2: What type of food holds the world record for being the most stolen around the globe? Answers: rice, cheese (correct), waffles, noodles . Question 3: What type of food is the most frequently ordered item in the USA? Answers: pizza, cheeseburger, hash browns, chicken (correct) . Question 4: What is the oldest soft drink in the United States? Answers: Dr. Pepper (correct), Coke, Sprite, Fanta . Question 5: Where does chicken adobo originate? Answers: Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines (correct), Malaysia . Console . Here is an image of me printing out a message to the console! Answers to questions: This message doesn’t print in the app. It prints out in the debug console. This is useful because you can display important messages like errors to developers instead of the user. You can also use this to debug your code by not displaying it on the application. . Elements . Something interesting I found was that you can create a button. You can keep track of all the elements you created by going to the Design tab and looking at the dropdown menus and your different screens. Another thing to keep in mind is to name your elements specifically so you know what element refers to what without having to go look at it each time, which is very time consuming. This also applies to any variables, you should name them specifically. . Discoveries . One discovery that I had was that you can change screens and create variable. This is useful in a quiz because you need to move onto future questions, which requires the changing of screens, and you also need to keep track of the user score, which means variables are necessary. . Challenges . Some challenges I had were that you couldn’t copy paste the blocks, but then I learned that you can click the text button to go to the raw code. This was useful because I could copy paste the code to speed up my process. . Successes . Some successes that I had were that I sucessfully created a 5-question food quiz, which tells you if you got the answer right or wrong after you click on an answer, and then at the end, it shows your score. . Link to Quiz . Here is a link to my quiz if you want to play it. . Quiz Design . Here is an image of what my quiz looks like: . Quiz Code . Here is an image of my quiz code: . Quiz Debugging .

The workload has been pretty easy so far, I have only spent maxium 10-20 minutes on the HW each night. . Period 2: Honors Humanities . Honors humanities is pretty fun and I enjoy all our discussion about art and aesthetics, the workload has also been pretty easy. I like Mrs. Philyaw’s energy in the classroom. . Period 3: AP World History . This might be one of my favorite classes right now because I like the energy and atmosphere of the classroom. I also really like my teacher, Ms. Volger. We haven’t gotten too deep into material yet though. . Period 4: AP CSP . I have been enjoying APCSP so far because it is a chill period, and I enjoy the tasks that we do, such as making a blog and coding in Python. . Period 5: AP Chem . I also enjoy AP Chem, and most of the work right now is review, but we are moving at a pretty fast pace. We did a paper chromatography lab on the first day in class, which I also liked. . . My Backpack . My backpack is pretty light right now. This is what I have in my backpack everyday: . 3-subject notebook for AP World History | 1-inch binder for AP Chem | 1 folder for all my classes | 1 graphing notebook for AP Calc | Some snacks for break | My laptop and charger | My lunch | Pencil pouch | Water | Summary .

Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. | To verify the tools we install, we can use --version commands (for example python --version) | . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? | You can check the version of Anaconda using conda -version. You can also type conda list to obtain the packages installed using anaconda. | . How would you update a repository? | To update a repository in VSCode, you can click the &quot;Source Control&quot; tab on the left and push changes. Remember to include a message (it is just a note to yourself on what you changed, but GitHub won&#39;t push it until there is that message) when you are pushing changes. | . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. | You can create scripts using coding languages (such as Bash and Python, two languages that we have been introduced to) to automate installation procedures, so you don&#39;t have to do any extra work!! | .",

Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Bash is UNIX shell and command language. It is the default login shell for most Linux distributions. | . Week 2 . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | A for loop iterates through a code a certain number of times. | A while loop continues to iterate through a block of code until a condition is false. | A recursion loop calls itself repeatedly. | . Week 3 . Creating performance task is very important, and I need to look at examples and the rubric to know exactly what I need to do. | Good Example A | Good Example B | Bad Example I | Bad Example H | Studying for the MCQ is very important, so I should take notes in one place. | . Week 4 . Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it | Flask is the Web Application Framework. Python will be the Backend Development languages. Jinja2 is the Web Template language, that work well with Flask and Python. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will support frontend work built into the Flask project.The external Fastpages/Github Pages project will use the Flask/Python project for backend services, like persistent data or databases (ie SQL). Docker can allow us to locally run our fastpages, so we can see changes immediately instead of pushing to GitHub and then waiting. | &lt;/ul&gt; | | .",

Variables: abstractions within programs which represent a value | Lists: made up of elements organized in a specific order | Element: unique, individual value in a list | . Unit 3 Sections 3-4 . Index: number representing a position, like a character&#39;s position in a string or a string&#39;s position in a list. | Concatenation: series of interconnected things | Substring: subset of a bigger string | Pseudocode: writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts | . Unit 3 Sections 5 and 7 . Boolean Operators: produces booleans after it is used between two values | Relational Operators: can work between any two values of the same type known as operands, provided that the type supports such types of operators | Logical Operators: operators that works on operand(s) to produce a single boolean result. Examples include and, or, not. | ALgorithm: A set of instructions that accomplish a task | Selection: The process that determines which parts of an algoritm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false | Nested Conditionals: consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | . Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10 . Lists: collections of data&lt;/ul&gt;li&gt; Indexes: Most code languages count starting with zero, and this is also the case for list indexes | Repetition: repetition of a function. Allowing a function to repeat on its own based on various conditions can vastly optimize a program | &lt;/ul&gt; Unit 3 Sections 12 and 13 . Parameters: input values of a procedure&lt;/ul&gt; | Procedure: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called | Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality | Procedural Abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it | . Unit 3 Sections 9 and 11 . Binary Search: efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value&lt;/ul&gt; | Searching Algorithms: could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each | Algorithms: can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | . Unit 3 Sections 14 and 15 . Packages: allow a python user to import methods from a library&lt;/ul&gt; | Random Values: number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring | . Unit 3 Section 16 . Simulations: abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world&lt;/ul&gt; | . Unit 3 Sections 17 and 18 . Problem: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically&lt;/ul&gt; | Decision Problem: A problem with a yes or no answer&lt;/ul&gt; | Organization Problem: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer&lt;/ul&gt; | Instance: a problem with a specific input2 &lt;/ul&gt; | Efficiency: amount of computing needed to solve a problem &lt;/ul&gt; | Polynomial Efficiency (Good): more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time) &lt;/ul&gt; | Exponential Efficiency (Bad): more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time) &lt;/ul&gt; | Heuristic Approach: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient &lt;/ul&gt; | Decidable Problem: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output &lt;/ul&gt; | Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution that is not gaurenteed to produce the correct output &lt;/ul&gt; | . | .",
