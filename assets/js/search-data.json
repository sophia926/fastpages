Be creative, for instance make a story of Computing and Networks that is related to your PBL experiences this year. . How a Computer Works . As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart. The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided. The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data. . List specification of your Computer, or Computers if working as Pair/Trio .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 . Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance. . | There are benefits to having multiple paths because if one path/wire goes down, the rest of the computers can still communicate. But the more wires means more resources are needed. | Fault-tolerant means that if some wires go down, the network can still work and end points can still communicate. A network must be thoroughly fault-tolerant to be considered fault-tolerant. | Redundacy is the inclusion of extra components to llimit failure of a system if other components fail. | .

            "title": "Data Structures - Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a **dictionary**. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is **O(1) -- constant time!**. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # . {1, 2, 3} . In the output, I noticed that it only printed 1, 2, and 3, even though the set originally had five items in it. The set only returned the unique values (it removed all duplicate values)! Sets are in the same tech talk as hashmaps/hashtables because they are similar -- there can only be unique values, like in python dictionaries, there can&#39;t be duplicate keys. Both of them can&#39;t have collisions/duplicates! . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

The Best Taylor Swift Song . The best TS song is definitely from the folklore album. I really like exile ft. Bon Iver because of the contrast between Taylor&#39;s soft, gentle voice and Bon Iver&#39;s deep voice. It gives the song a lot of depth, and the lyrics are also very emotional and moving. The song is very haunting and it stays with you for a long time. .",

Provide answers and thoughts on theoritical question form college board Video in section 4.3. They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1:The minimum amount of time to execute all three processes when the two processors are run in parallel is 50 seconds. Process X can be run on Processor 1, so that will take 50 seconds, and while that is running Process Y can run on processor 2, for 10 seconds. When Process Y is done, Process X is still continuing to run, but processor 2 is open so Process Z can be run on processor 2. That will take another 30 seconds. Then, after Process Z is finished, Process X still takes 10 more seconds to complete. That in total takes 50 seconds, the amount of time for Process X to run.- Example 2: If you run them on a single processor one after another, then it will take 25 seconds plus 45 seconds, so it will take 70 seconds. However, if you run them in parallel, then it will only take 45 seconds, the amount of time for Process B to run because Process B takes longer than Process A.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space complexity because they need to make sure their program can run with the physical memory of the system that they will run on. They need to make sure their program works even with physical constraints, such as memory. | Programmers should care about time complexity because it can help programers evaluate which algorithm is most efficient to achieve optimal conditions and running time.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Time: 0.1secs . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0

This took a really time: I stopped the program at 2:44 and it was still running. Clearly, this time complexity is very poor. . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Example of Matrix Multiplication . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Time: 0.4s . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . A visualization of calculating the fibonacci sequence . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Time: 0.1s . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Time: 0.3s . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. .

Done! | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Selection sort/Bubble sort/Insertion sort: O(n^2) | Heap/Quick/Merge: O(n log(n)) | Bucket/Count sort: O(n+k) | Radix sort: O(nk) | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because you want to choose the algorithm that requires the least space and time to run, so investigating this will help your program achieve maximum efficiency. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? You should sometimes use an exponential time algorithm because at lower values and less data values, they can be faster than constant time algorithms. It just depends on how much data you&#39;r eprocessing. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? Some general patterns I noticed were that loops often determine the time complexity. Look for the general structure of the program as well as nested for loops. | . | .

Answer: n(n-1) because the first loop will run n times and the other loop will run (n-1) times. . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. . True False . Answer: False because it depends on what n is. .",

Here is the second question I got wrong. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet.

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab some file types are: PNG, JPG, GIF and they each have different purposes and headers | . | Size, height and width, number of pixels the greater the size, height, width, number of pixels --&gt; greater the need for data compression because they take up more space | . | Visual perception, lossy compression Lossy compression: reduce file size by trashing what&#39;s deemed as &quot;less important&quot; | . | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, rm are the main commands | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? dir, ren, chdir | . | What are some of the major differences? The major differences are the command names, ex:ls in linux VS dir in Windows Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. | . | Why is path a big deal when working with images? The path is a big deal because it determines where the image is in relation to a directory or where the user currently is, allows the image to be properly accessed/displayed | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? Unit 5 is Impact of Computing, about developing computer programms to process and analyze data. The meta data source and label relates to this because it involves text, images, video, and how to change this data. Metadata is the information embedded into a file, such as the date/time o an image, as well as the type of camera, the camera settings, and the location of the image. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, aka Jupyter Notebook. Iy is a platform to write data, code, and documentation all in one place. This is useful because you can store all the metadata and format it into Pandas dataframes. | . | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Sophia Tang&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;smiley face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smileyface.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . - Base 64, binary, and hexadecimal are similar because they both translate characters and bytes. Base 64 takes 4 characters for every 3 bytes, while hex only takes two characters for each byte. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. &quot;sop&quot; translates to &quot;c29w&quot; | . | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? When I watch a video that is very large and my Internet is slow, it buffers. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? I have experienced delays and annoyance due to waiting from buffering. | . | How do these effects apply to images? The larger the image, the longer the buffer, the longer it takes to load and the more stress it puts on the system. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes there are a series of steps being performed. | . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? First, the images are prepared and added to the dictionary of images. Then, the average of all the pixel values is calculated as the greyscale of the image. Then, a new image is generated, based on the averages. | . | Describe scale image?

Explain. Lossy compression:irreversable process where some of the data is removed to reduce file size. Examples are reducing the file size to send across the Internet faster, such as through an email. Common formats are JPEGs and GIFs. For example, when you scan a file on CamScanner and share it, it asks if you want to share the actual size or a smaller size. This is lossy compression to increase efficiency. - Lossless compression is when the the image is reduced without quality loss. File types are GZIP, Brotli, WebP, and PNG. Examples is database records, spreadsheets, and word processing files. | . | . Project Addition . If your project has images in it, try to implement an image change that has a purpose. (Ex.

From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data?

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

One of them that I really liked was a recipe project that used APIs to get recipes and nutritional information. I love cooking and am a big foodie, so this project really appealed to me and inspired me. Seeing everyone’s final projects was very motivating because it truly shows the power of CS and how a small team can get so much done in just a few weeks by collaborating and CODING! . I also visited the Photography and Art exhibitions. It was an interesting experience because I got to see all types of art. Overall, I was exposed to more of DNHS’s creative potential, and I realized that DNHS is really diverse and has a lot of people with many interesting, creative thoughts and ideas.

It should include all the requirements, like we have been grading in our previous blogs. . For my group’s CPT, we are going to create a website that helps students manage their school and productivity life, to help high achieving studets. The intended audience is high school students specifically. Personally, I’m going to be working on the “MyDay” portion, which is where users will enter in their tasks and ETA, and then the system will output and estimated bed time. . In my writeup and video, I will explicitly say the program purpose and functionality, which I have already planned out and described. I will be able to test the program, inputting different tasks and estimated times.

            "content": "5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects . Grammarly . Benefits: Real time grammar checking, improved writing, easy to understand explanations, expanded vocabulary use and diction | Disadvantages: premium costs money so students without Grammarly Premium (unable to pay for the premium subscription) are at an academic disadvantage to those students who do have Premium | . Artificial Intelligence . Benefits: Reduces human error with automated tasks, available 24/7, helpful in repetitive jobs such as in product manufacturing | Disadvantages: may make unemployment worse and replace human jobs, makes humans lazy, lacks creativity and out of the box thinking, very limited to the data you train it with | . Self Driving Cars . Benefits: decreased traffic flow from self driving cars able to navigate more efficiently, easier access for disabled and elderly since they can just have the cars drive for them | Disadvantages: needs large scale adoption in order to be effective, hackers and cybersecurity threats to the cars, moral dilemna of what happens in the case of a car crash | . Dopamine Issue . I think addiction / dopamine issue is real, and that technology is meant ot be addictive. I watched “The Social Dilemna” on Netflix and it shockingly explains that social media is literally built so that you get addicted. Every feature and aspect is fine tuned to target your brain’s reward systems and release dopamine. This is dangerous because it can lead to physical and mental health issues. It can harm students because they get addicted to technology/games/social media instead of studying and as a result their grades can decline. | . 5.2 Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by staying in control of all their online and digital activities/interactions with technology, rather than letting others or the Internet control them. One can stay aware of their activities and what they are doing, to gauge whether it is healthy or not. One should also take action to protect themselves online, such as making secure passwords and personalizing privacy settings. | . | How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by asking them what they need help with but also not embarrasing or humiliating them by doing that. Something you can do at DNHS is to join clubs that empower those who need it. | . | Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Paper isn’t blocking digital empowerment because there are still things that are necessary to be on paper. DNHS does have some barriers to digital empowerment because we still do some activities on paper, such as math tests. Elsewhere, there are still barriers to digital empowerment, such as lack of funding or infrastructure, especially in third world countries. | . | . 5.3 Computing Bias . Facebook VS Instagram: Facebook targets the older generation, while Instagram/Tiktok/Snapchat target the teenager population and overlal younger demographics. So Facebook is more content-driven and information-based, while the other younger social media platforms try to hop on trends to attract the younger generation’s attention. | Virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri by default have female voices. This can potentially be harmful because it can reinforce the stereotype that women are subordinate and can only help in management, while men are the people that actually control and manage tasks. However, this can also be just a result of companies wanting to maximize profits after results from testing show that people prefer female voices over male voices. | Many algorithms influence your decisions because they try to get you addicted to their platform. For instance, YouTube tracks the types of videos you have watched in the past and recommends similar videos. Also, Netflix and YouTube employ autoplay to try to get you to stay on their platform longer. These algorithms also hop on trends and recommend you things that society/the general population currently likes. | The HP camera didn’t have enough training data, or in other words it didn’t have complete trianing data that encompassed all demographics, because it didn’t recognize the Black person’s face. THis is harmful and should be corrected by including data that is inclusive of everybody. This practice is very harmful because it makes it seem like Black people aren’t real people, according to the camera/algorithm. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? A crowdsource idea would be to gather some data from APCSP students, such as for a survey about their extracurriculars or school or their opinion on a certain topic. | . | What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Our project includes crowdsourcing from DNHS because it is actually specifically targeted towards DNHS students, as we collect the students’ schedules, teachers, and other school-related information | . | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week Some data that we could capture at N@TM would be to ask some students to create accounts and enter in their data on our project, and then use this to test it out, because that is the whole purpose of the project. This would showcase the function and purpose of our project very well. | . | . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. MIT license is pretty good. Some permissions are commercial use, distribution, modification, and private use. The limitations are liability and warranty. | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. Software licenses have legal implications because they aren’t always followed. Digital rights are also a concern because information is still often pirated online. | . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update I have the Apache License 2.0 for my personal fastpages. I chose this because the limitations are liability, trademark use, and warranty, meaning that the main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/ | For my group project frontend and backend, I applied the GNU GPLv3 license (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). We created the LICENSE.md file to edit the license. We created a text file called LICENSE.md in the root of our source code (main branch) and copied the text of the license into the file. This license has the following permissions: commerical use, distribution, modification, patent use, and private use. The conditions are: disclose source, license and copyright notice, same license, and state changes. The limitations are: liability and warranty. We chose this license because others have to disclose our source if they use our code. | . | . 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. I have seen student names, student grades, and also student classes in CompSci Principles projects. | . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I am insecure about PII and my personal exposure because I genuinely don’t want other people to know things like my address, phone #, and the people I live with because that information should stay with me and it’s insecure to have it on the web. | . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Good passwords are passwords that are long, are complex, and have complex characters. They also shouldn’t contain PII, like birthdays. They shouldn’t be simple like “qwerty” or have common dictionary words because those are easily crackable by password cracking tools, such as John the Ripper. | Another step used to assist authentication is encryption, such as synchronous and async encryption. Keys are also important. This can protect your information as you send it online. | . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is less secure because one key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in asymmetric encryption different keys are used. | . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. An example of encryption was the RSA and SHA keys. | . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. I learned about phishing when I received some spam emails claiming I won some awards. Some phishing techniques are to say that you can get a free thing by entering in some PII, like credit cards or addresses. | . | .",

Question 13 I can see now that choice III is also right because it basically does the same thing as II but flipped. Like it tests if the person is less than 18 and then if they are older than 16, and II is vice versa. . Question 16 I now understand that sequencing is applying steps in a specific order, which was already a function of the algorithm. Selection would be necessary because you need to select only the even numbers to sum, and therefore C is correct. . Question 27 I now see that the option I chose would not be the correct algorithm because the cursor needs to move forward n times and then turn, not alternate moving forward and turning. . Question 45 A heuristic solution is when you are on a time crunch, so you just need an approximate solution in a reasonable amount of time. I can now see that option C is correct. I had misunderstood Option A before. . Overall Reflection . I completed the quiz pretty easily, and I thought most of the questions were pretty straightforward. I might have to review some vocabulary though, because questions 16 and 45 were both vocabulary-based, and I got them wrong. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Reflection: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 4, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not.

Reflection: I graded exactly the same as Collegeboard here, basically the only thing missing was the purpose of the program. This is different than the functionality of the program! because the purpose should address the problem being solved or the creative interest being pursued by the program. The function is different because it is how the program works during execution and how the user interacts with it.

For row 2, I shouldn’t have awarded a point because the second code segment didn’t access the actual list, it only took the length. For row 3, the list doesn’t manage complexity.

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word from, followed by the package name, then the word import, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use *. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word as, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random from random import randint import random as rand . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . The command I used that wasn&#39;t mentioned was &quot;oogway.backward&quot; . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | computes the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x | . floor(x) | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial of x (for example factorial(4) is 4) | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package!

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . I chose option 1. I also added something extra where the length of the sides of the polygon is randomized, also the user can input a color! .",

Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: other names for procedures include methods, strategies, . Why are procedures effective?: have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program, Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code, MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure, able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does, helps identify errors/bugs . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . function convertToBinary(n) { const result = n.toString(parseInt(2)); return result; } convertToBinary(10); . &#39;1010&#39; . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . function findMax(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &gt; numberB) { return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } function findMin(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &lt; numberB) { return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } console.log(findMax(10, 20)); console.log(findMin(10, 20)); . 20 10 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . function convert(hello){ var output = &quot;&quot;; output.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;; for (var i = 0; i &lt; hello.length; i++){ output = output + hello[i].charCodeAt(0).toString(2) + &quot; &quot;; } return output; } console.log(&quot;APCSP to binary is...&quot;) console.log(convert(&quot;APCSP&quot;)); . APCSP to binary is... 1000001 1010000 1000011 1010011 1010000 . I did everything in JavaScript, and I also did the challenge for the HW (converting &quot;APCSP&quot; to binary). .",

Items in lists are located with indexes, which, in most code languages, start with 0 (though the pseudocode used by CollegeBoard usually starts at 1!). | Lists are incredibly helpful because you can use them to store unlimited amounts of data, and using loops and functions that locate list data using indexes, the information can be procedurally used in a way that suits a certain purpose. | .

            "content": "Psychology and the Good Life Notes . Here are my notes from the video: . This enterprise if possible: We can improve our well-being, and we can control much more than we think. | . | Circumstances don’t matter that much. We think life’s circumstances matter a lot, but they don’t matter as much as we think. For example, winning the loterry. What we think will make us happy often doesn’t after some time, and the vice versa is true. Perhaps life circumstances only affect 10%. | . | Taking control of it, is kind of hard. You can bump up your own well-being if you do it everyday. You need to have permanent changes and be consistent with it. It’s going to take some work. You have to put the stuff in practice, not just learning it. | . | One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuitions don’t work. Your mind is lying to you a lot of the time when you think you’re happy. For example, illusions tric your mind so you can’t fully rely on your mind! We forecast stuff that will make us happy, when in reality it doesn’t in the end. For example, we predict that we need more money to be happy (choosing a job based on salary), but when are you going to be satisfied? Ever? | . | Make time for social connection Prioritize the people you care about in life. Spend more time with others, family, friends, loved ones. Spend less time alone. | . | Helping others Helping others help us more than we expect! Happy people give their time to others and spend money on others. | . | Make time for gratitude Many people talk about their hassles in life (ugh, that person is so annoying) rather than the other 99% of people that make your life great! You can make a gratitude list or even express your gratitude with a letter, for example. | . | Healthy practices matter Exercise (1/2 hour of cardio a day is the equivalent of anti-depressants), sleep (current HS students average 4-5 hours a night). These all improve mood GREATLY! | . | Taking time in the present moment Don’t be distracted by your electronics, phones, etc. Realize you are in the present! | . | Become wealthy (in terms of time) Don’t have a time famine (“I don’t have time for anything!”) People who priotize time over money have a better well-being. | . | Gratitude List . I am grateful for many things. Here are some: . friends and family | plentiful, healthy, and delicious food | going to school and being able to learn | the ability to move around and exercise | going to social events and hanging out with people | music that I can listen to in any mood | . Gratitude to my friend . Here is a gratitude message I sent to my friend: “i just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me and thanks for being my best friend and staying with me no matter what :)” . Gratitude to someone at home . Here is a gratitude I wrote to my mom: “Thank you for being the very best mom to me! You are such an amazing person and I love you so much! Thanks for putting up with me for already 15 years, I can’t even believe it :)” . Goals . Here are some goals I want to set. . Studying and Academic - I want to be productive and study well. I don’t want to get distracted and procrastinate when I’m working. I will take some short breaks, but I will get all my work done before doing other things. | Personal Life - I want to focus on myself as well. I want to do something that I enjoy doing at least once every day. That can be something as simple as reading or cooking, but I want to be able to enjoy everyday. | Reading - I want to read more because I’m a little busy nowadays, so I barely read anymore. This ties along with my first goal because if I’m more productive, I can have more time for my personal life and reading as well. | My Personal Journey for Computer Science . I want to learn a lot in this APCSP class. I also want to join a coding club at school. Also, I want to learn some more coding, like Python and C++. . Something I Did For Myself . On Thursday (9/15), I cooked something I wanted to for a long time. I was very stressed from my workload and all the work I had to do, but I wnated to take a step back and just de-stress. This would help my mood and minset to be more productive after dinner! So I made avocado pasta and it actually turned out pretty good :) My mom also liked it! .",

The todo list data and goal data will be stored in databases and lists. . Managing Complexity . The database and list will manage the complexity of the program because it is necessary for filtering and displaying. . Procedural Abstraction . I will create functions for filtering the data for the user to see, which is a procedural abstraction. . Algorithm Implementation . I will create functions for sequencing, selecting, and iterating for displaying the goals and todo lists, which satisfies this condition. . Testing . When the user interacts with the program, it will constantly call the functions I will code, which satisfies this requirement. . AP Exam MCQ .

Question 1: Which of the following foods can never go bad? Answers: chocolate, hard candy, honey (correct), water . Question 2: What type of food holds the world record for being the most stolen around the globe? Answers: rice, cheese (correct), waffles, noodles . Question 3: What type of food is the most frequently ordered item in the USA? Answers: pizza, cheeseburger, hash browns, chicken (correct) . Question 4: What is the oldest soft drink in the United States? Answers: Dr. Pepper (correct), Coke, Sprite, Fanta . Question 5: Where does chicken adobo originate? Answers: Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines (correct), Malaysia . Console . Here is an image of me printing out a message to the console! Answers to questions: This message doesn’t print in the app. It prints out in the debug console. This is useful because you can display important messages like errors to developers instead of the user. You can also use this to debug your code by not displaying it on the application. . Elements . Something interesting I found was that you can create a button. You can keep track of all the elements you created by going to the Design tab and looking at the dropdown menus and your different screens. Another thing to keep in mind is to name your elements specifically so you know what element refers to what without having to go look at it each time, which is very time consuming. This also applies to any variables, you should name them specifically. . Discoveries . One discovery that I had was that you can change screens and create variable. This is useful in a quiz because you need to move onto future questions, which requires the changing of screens, and you also need to keep track of the user score, which means variables are necessary. . Challenges . Some challenges I had were that you couldn’t copy paste the blocks, but then I learned that you can click the text button to go to the raw code. This was useful because I could copy paste the code to speed up my process. . Successes . Some successes that I had were that I sucessfully created a 5-question food quiz, which tells you if you got the answer right or wrong after you click on an answer, and then at the end, it shows your score. . Link to Quiz . Here is a link to my quiz if you want to play it. . Quiz Design . Here is an image of what my quiz looks like: . Quiz Code . Here is an image of my quiz code: . Quiz Debugging .

The workload has been pretty easy so far, I have only spent maxium 10-20 minutes on the HW each night. . Period 2: Honors Humanities . Honors humanities is pretty fun and I enjoy all our discussion about art and aesthetics, the workload has also been pretty easy. I like Mrs. Philyaw’s energy in the classroom. . Period 3: AP World History . This might be one of my favorite classes right now because I like the energy and atmosphere of the classroom. I also really like my teacher, Ms. Volger. We haven’t gotten too deep into material yet though. . Period 4: AP CSP . I have been enjoying APCSP so far because it is a chill period, and I enjoy the tasks that we do, such as making a blog and coding in Python. . Period 5: AP Chem . I also enjoy AP Chem, and most of the work right now is review, but we are moving at a pretty fast pace. We did a paper chromatography lab on the first day in class, which I also liked. . . My Backpack . My backpack is pretty light right now. This is what I have in my backpack everyday: . 3-subject notebook for AP World History | 1-inch binder for AP Chem | 1 folder for all my classes | 1 graphing notebook for AP Calc | Some snacks for break | My laptop and charger | My lunch | Pencil pouch | Water | Summary .

Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. | To verify the tools we install, we can use --version commands (for example python --version) | . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? | You can check the version of Anaconda using conda -version. You can also type conda list to obtain the packages installed using anaconda. | . How would you update a repository? | To update a repository in VSCode, you can click the &quot;Source Control&quot; tab on the left and push changes. Remember to include a message (it is just a note to yourself on what you changed, but GitHub won&#39;t push it until there is that message) when you are pushing changes. | . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. | You can create scripts using coding languages (such as Bash and Python, two languages that we have been introduced to) to automate installation procedures, so you don&#39;t have to do any extra work!! | .",

Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Bash is UNIX shell and command language. It is the default login shell for most Linux distributions. | . Week 2 . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | A for loop iterates through a code a certain number of times. | A while loop continues to iterate through a block of code until a condition is false. | A recursion loop calls itself repeatedly. | . Week 3 . Creating performance task is very important, and I need to look at examples and the rubric to know exactly what I need to do. | Good Example A | Good Example B | Bad Example I | Bad Example H | Studying for the MCQ is very important, so I should take notes in one place. | . Week 4 . Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it | Flask is the Web Application Framework. Python will be the Backend Development languages. Jinja2 is the Web Template language, that work well with Flask and Python. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will support frontend work built into the Flask project.The external Fastpages/Github Pages project will use the Flask/Python project for backend services, like persistent data or databases (ie SQL). Docker can allow us to locally run our fastpages, so we can see changes immediately instead of pushing to GitHub and then waiting. | &lt;/ul&gt; | | .",

Variables: abstractions within programs which represent a value | Lists: made up of elements organized in a specific order | Element: unique, individual value in a list | . Unit 3 Sections 3-4 . Index: number representing a position, like a character&#39;s position in a string or a string&#39;s position in a list. | Concatenation: series of interconnected things | Substring: subset of a bigger string | Pseudocode: writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts | . Unit 3 Sections 5 and 7 . Boolean Operators: produces booleans after it is used between two values | Relational Operators: can work between any two values of the same type known as operands, provided that the type supports such types of operators | Logical Operators: operators that works on operand(s) to produce a single boolean result. Examples include and, or, not. | ALgorithm: A set of instructions that accomplish a task | Selection: The process that determines which parts of an algoritm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false | Nested Conditionals: consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | . Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10 . Lists: collections of data&lt;/ul&gt;li&gt; Indexes: Most code languages count starting with zero, and this is also the case for list indexes | Repetition: repetition of a function. Allowing a function to repeat on its own based on various conditions can vastly optimize a program | &lt;/ul&gt; Unit 3 Sections 12 and 13 . Parameters: input values of a procedure&lt;/ul&gt; | Procedure: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called | Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality | Procedural Abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it | . Unit 3 Sections 9 and 11 . Binary Search: efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value&lt;/ul&gt; | Searching Algorithms: could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each | Algorithms: can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | . Unit 3 Sections 14 and 15 . Packages: allow a python user to import methods from a library&lt;/ul&gt; | Random Values: number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring | . Unit 3 Section 16 . Simulations: abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world&lt;/ul&gt; | . Unit 3 Sections 17 and 18 . Problem: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically&lt;/ul&gt; | Decision Problem: A problem with a yes or no answer&lt;/ul&gt; | Organization Problem: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer&lt;/ul&gt; | Instance: a problem with a specific input2 &lt;/ul&gt; | Efficiency: amount of computing needed to solve a problem &lt;/ul&gt; | Polynomial Efficiency (Good): more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time) &lt;/ul&gt; | Exponential Efficiency (Bad): more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time) &lt;/ul&gt; | Heuristic Approach: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient &lt;/ul&gt; | Decidable Problem: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output &lt;/ul&gt; | Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution that is not gaurenteed to produce the correct output &lt;/ul&gt; | . | .",
