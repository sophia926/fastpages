This enterprise if possible: We can improve our well-being, and we can control much more than we think. | . | Circumstances don’t matter that much. We think life’s circumstances matter a lot, but they don’t matter as much as we think. For example, winning the loterry. What we think will make us happy often doesn’t after some time, and the vice versa is true. Perhaps life circumstances only affect 10%. | . | Taking control of it, is kind of hard. You can bump up your own well-being if you do it everyday. You need to have permanent changes and be consistent with it. It’s going to take some work. You have to put the stuff in practice, not just learning it. | . | One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuitions don’t work. Your mind is lying to you a lot of the time when you think you’re happy. For example, illusions tric your mind so you can’t fully rely on your mind! We forecast stuff that will make us happy, when in reality it doesn’t in the end. For example, we predict that we need more money to be happy (choosing a job based on salary), but when are you going to be satisfied? Ever? | . | Make time for social connection Prioritize the people you care about in life. Spend more time with others, family, friends, loved ones. Spend less time alone. | . | Helping others Helping others help us more than we expect! Happy people give their time to others and spend money on others. | . | Make time for gratitude Many people talk about their hassles in life (ugh, that person is so annoying) rather than the other 99% of people that make your life great! You can make a gratitude list or even express your gratitude with a letter, for example. | . | Healthy practices matter Exercise (1/2 hour of cardio a day is the equivalent of anti-depressants), sleep (current HS students average 4-5 hours a night). These all improve mood GREATLY! | . | Taking time in the present moment Don’t be distracted by your electronics, phones, etc. Realize you are in the present! | . | Become wealthy (in terms of time) Don’t have a time famine (“I don’t have time for anything!”) People who priotize time over money have a better well-being. | . | Gratitude List . I am grateful for many things. Here are some: . friends and family | plentiful, healthy, and delicious food | going to school and being able to learn | the ability to move around and exercise | going to social events and hanging out with people | music that I can listen to in any mood | . Gratitude to my friend . Here is a gratitude message I sent to my friend: “i just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me and thanks for being my best friend and staying with me no matter what :)” . Gratitude to someone at home . Here is a gratitude I wrote to my mom: “Thank you for being the very best mom to me! You are such an amazing person and I love you so much! Thanks for putting up with me for already 15 years, I can’t even believe it :)” . Goals . Here are some goals I want to set. . Studying and Academic - I want to be productive and study well. I don’t want to get distracted and procrastinate when I’m working. I will take some short breaks, but I will get all my work done before doing other things. | Personal Life - I want to focus on myself as well. I want to do something that I enjoy doing at least once every day. That can be something as simple as reading or cooking, but I want to be able to enjoy everyday. | Reading - I want to read more because I’m a little busy nowadays, so I barely read anymore. This ties along with my first goal because if I’m more productive, I can have more time for my personal life and reading as well. | My Personal Journey for Computer Science . I want to learn a lot in this APCSP class. I also want to join a coding club at school. Also, I want to learn some more coding, like Python and C++. . Something I Did For Myself . On Thursday (9/15), I cooked something I wanted to for a long time. I was very stressed from my workload and all the work I had to do, but I wnated to take a step back and just de-stress. This would help my mood and minset to be more productive after dinner! So I made avocado pasta and it actually turned out pretty good :) My mom also liked it! .",

The todo list data and goal data will be stored in databases and lists. . Managing Complexity . The database and list will manage the complexity of the program because it is necessary for filtering and displaying. . Procedural Abstraction . I will create functions for filtering the data for the user to see, which is a procedural abstraction. . Algorithm Implementation . I will create functions for sequencing, selecting, and iterating for displaying the goals and todo lists, which satisfies this condition. . Testing . When the user interacts with the program, it will constantly call the functions I will code, which satisfies this requirement. . AP Exam MCQ .

Question 1: Which of the following foods can never go bad? Answers: chocolate, hard candy, honey (correct), water . Question 2: What type of food holds the world record for being the most stolen around the globe? Answers: rice, cheese (correct), waffles, noodles . Question 3: What type of food is the most frequently ordered item in the USA? Answers: pizza, cheeseburger, hash browns, chicken (correct) . Question 4: What is the oldest soft drink in the United States? Answers: Dr. Pepper (correct), Coke, Sprite, Fanta . Question 5: Where does chicken adobo originate? Answers: Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines (correct), Malaysia . Console . Here is an image of me printing out a message to the console! Answers to questions: This message doesn’t print in the app. It prints out in the debug console. This is useful because you can display important messages like errors to developers instead of the user. You can also use this to debug your code by not displaying it on the application. . Elements . Something interesting I found was that you can create a button. You can keep track of all the elements you created by going to the Design tab and looking at the dropdown menus and your different screens. Another thing to keep in mind is to name your elements specifically so you know what element refers to what without having to go look at it each time, which is very time consuming. This also applies to any variables, you should name them specifically. . Discoveries . One discovery that I had was that you can change screens and create variable. This is useful in a quiz because you need to move onto future questions, which requires the changing of screens, and you also need to keep track of the user score, which means variables are necessary. . Challenges . Some challenges I had were that you couldn’t copy paste the blocks, but then I learned that you can click the text button to go to the raw code. This was useful because I could copy paste the code to speed up my process. . Successes . Some successes that I had were that I sucessfully created a 5-question food quiz, which tells you if you got the answer right or wrong after you click on an answer, and then at the end, it shows your score. . Link to Quiz . Here is a link to my quiz if you want to play it. . Quiz Design . Here is an image of what my quiz looks like: . Quiz Code . Here is an image of my quiz code: . Quiz Debugging .

The workload has been pretty easy so far, I have only spent maxium 10-20 minutes on the HW each night. . Period 2: Honors Humanities . Honors humanities is pretty fun and I enjoy all our discussion about art and aesthetics, the workload has also been pretty easy. I like Mrs. Philyaw’s energy in the classroom. . Period 3: AP World History . This might be one of my favorite classes right now because I like the energy and atmosphere of the classroom. I also really like my teacher, Ms. Volger. We haven’t gotten too deep into material yet though. . Period 4: AP CSP . I have been enjoying APCSP so far because it is a chill period, and I enjoy the tasks that we do, such as making a blog and coding in Python. . Period 5: AP Chem . I also enjoy AP Chem, and most of the work right now is review, but we are moving at a pretty fast pace. We did a paper chromatography lab on the first day in class, which I also liked. . . My Backpack . My backpack is pretty light right now. This is what I have in my backpack everyday: . 3-subject notebook for AP World History | 1-inch binder for AP Chem | 1 folder for all my classes | 1 graphing notebook for AP Calc | Some snacks for break | My laptop and charger | My lunch | Pencil pouch | Water | Summary .

Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. | To verify the tools we install, we can use --version commands (for example python --version) | . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? | You can check the version of Anaconda using conda -version. You can also type conda list to obtain the packages installed using anaconda. | . How would you update a repository? | To update a repository in VSCode, you can click the &quot;Source Control&quot; tab on the left and push changes. Remember to include a message (it is just a note to yourself on what you changed, but GitHub won&#39;t push it until there is that message) when you are pushing changes. | . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. | You can create scripts using coding languages (such as Bash and Python, two languages that we have been introduced to) to automate installation procedures, so you don&#39;t have to do any extra work!! | .",

Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Bash is UNIX shell and command language. It is the default login shell for most Linux distributions. | . Week 2 . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | A for loop iterates through a code a certain number of times. | A while loop continues to iterate through a block of code until a condition is false. | A recursion loop calls itself repeatedly. | . Week 3 . Creating performance task is very important, and I need to look at examples and the rubric to know exactly what I need to do. | Good Example A | Good Example B | Bad Example I | Bad Example H | Studying for the MCQ is very important, so I should take notes in one place. | . Week 4 . Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it | Flask is the Web Application Framework. Python will be the Backend Development languages. Jinja2 is the Web Template language, that work well with Flask and Python. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will support frontend work built into the Flask project.The external Fastpages/Github Pages project will use the Flask/Python project for backend services, like persistent data or databases (ie SQL). Docker can allow us to locally run our fastpages, so we can see changes immediately instead of pushing to GitHub and then waiting. | &lt;/ul&gt; | | .",
