<ul>
  <li>Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it</li>
  <li>A computing innovation includes a program as an important part of its function (can be physical or non-physical)</li>
  <li>Collaboration helps avoid bias</li>
  <li>The answer to the question in the video was B.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Pair programming: one person is the “driver” who codes while the other person looks at each line of code as it is typed, switch back and forth!</li>
  <li>Think pair share: think about a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, share with the class</li>
  <li>Leave comments in the code to make sure you know what you’re doing, especially in the future
    <ul>
      <li>Acknowledge code/media used from other people/sources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Collaboration tools: repl.it, github (what our APCSP class is using), shared doc/folder</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>My group setup is not strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests because we did not know each other before but now have become friends.</li>
  <li>My group setup is with diversity because we all have varying computer science levels and also we both boys and girls. We have a diverse backgrounds: Taiwanese, Korean, Chinese, and Israelian.</li>
  <li>My group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classrooms because we can work together very well.</li>
</ol>
