<p>I have implemented the Python/Flask web server on my localhost, and you can see a screenshot of it working below.

<p>I have also changed the Stub.html which automatically updated on my site, which demonstrates that my python server is working. Here is an image of the changed Stub.html that I coded.

<p>This is evidence that I successfully pushed the above changes to Github.

<p>I also changed the Stub.html even more and added my school schedule :)

<p>I have locally edited, saved, and refreshed the Web Server, which are reflected in the images above.</p>

<p>The local ip address that it runs on (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) is basically my localhost and will not be available to other people to see because they are not running my computer and are therefore not local.</p>
