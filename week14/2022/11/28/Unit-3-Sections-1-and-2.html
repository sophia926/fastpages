  <li>Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value</li>
  <li>Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values</li>
  <li>Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings</li>
  <li>A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order</li>
  <li>An element is a unique, individual value in a list</li>
  <li>A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements</li>
  <li>
    <p>Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table</p>
  </li>
  <li>python lists are very powerful and you can organize different elements into lists</li>
  <li>variables are very powerful because you can perform math, functions, dictionaries, and lots of other things on variables that make themv ery flexible</li>
