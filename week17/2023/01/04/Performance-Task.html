<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded mostly the same as Collegeboard, only for Row 3, I gave a point whereas Collegeboard did not. This is because the list does not manage complexity and is not absolutely necessary for the program. I can now see that the list is not necessary because return statements of strings would achieve the same result.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: I graded exactly the same as Collegeboard here, all 1s. I could definitely tell this person was very detailed and thoroughly completed the Performance Task, and Collegeboard saw the same. This is a good example of the Performance Task, and I will definitely be saving it for future reference for when I create my Performance Task. I can use this as a base and a model for mine, to make sure I can achieve the maximum score as well. I will save the link to this person’s Performance Task for reference. Here is the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2022-create-performance-task-sample-a.pdf">link to the written responses</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/tEXoC-zYsrU">link to the video</a>. Here is the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap22-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf">link to Collegeboard rubric</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h1BDVPlYfXE5Lg1AZ8VdWJf6erT3hQ4e/view">link to the Collegeboard reasoning for this person’s Performance Task</a>.</p>
